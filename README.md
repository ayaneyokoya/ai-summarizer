## Description

For this project, I implemented OpenAI's GPT model in order to create a webpage that allows users to submit a URL link to an article and have a generated synopsis of the text.
Through this project, I was able to learn how to setup a ReactJS project using Vite, create a responsive UI/UX using Tailwind CSS, make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition, save history using the local storage, handle form events and catch errors, and implement copy to clipboard.
